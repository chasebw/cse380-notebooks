        "The Pigeonhole principle is simple, intuitive, and what\n",
        "seems like an obvious idea that has been standardized. I guess that is what principles normally are. The Pigeonhole principle is interesting as it seems simple when we are talking about just 4 pigeons and 3 pigeonholes. However, when you scale the problem to have more pigeonholes or more factors, that's when it gets more complicated to solve and understand plainly. This principle however is fun and has power as mentioned in the article in mathematical proofs, and solving problems like the one for this week's assignment. It seems to be talking about sets when I first look at it. To me I see the principle talking about how there is at least one set that has these characteristics, and where the set item will be repeated. I think it is interesting that what the pigeonhole represents is what is mentioned in this assignment as a certainity-not-chance feature. This meaning that what we are stating is not probablistic but entirely fact and reality about a given situation. This fact may not be identifying an item or what characteristic of an item but it identifying a feature of the group. This statement of fact is that of existence not of identification nessecarily. Meaning we know something in particular about the set or group we are talking about but not nessecarily the pair or particular pigeonhole being talked about.\n",

She also mentioned that this principle is also just plain obvious in some ways or common sense. She also mentioned that it does seem interesting, however.\n",
